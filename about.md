I am a Master's student at the Computer Games lab at McGill University. I am currently working on floating-point optimization of weights in neural networks during training. I currently live in Montreal.

My research interests mainly lie in the application of machine learning in solving-day-to-day problems. Some areas of interest are computer games, traffic networks and optimization. I am also interested in learning and applying machine learning techniques in image segmentation, fMRI analysis and video and sports analysis.

Prior to joing McGill for my Master's degree, I was working at Infosys for 2 years, where I published 2 papers on improving resolution time of maintenance tickets using Fuzzy C-means clustering on summary of ticket description and creating a regression model out of that. I had also created several frameworks and prototypes, mainly focusing on data science and analytics.

My undergraduate education was from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, where I studied for my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from 2011 to 2015.
